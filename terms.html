            <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to the developer.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. Use License</h3>
            <p>Permission is granted to download one copy of the "Emotion Diary" app for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>The app is provided on an 'as is' basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>
            <p>This app is for informational and self-tracking purposes only and is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. Limitations</h3>
            <p>In no event shall the developer or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the app.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">5. Data Loss</h3>
            <p>Since "Emotion Diary" stores data locally on your device, deleting the app may result in the permanent loss of your data. We are not responsible for any loss of data caused by deleting the app, device failure, or other reasons.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">6. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.</p>
